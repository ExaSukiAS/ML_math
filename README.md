# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental **Machine Learning algorithms**, built **from scratch** using only mathematical principles and theoretical foundations.  

The purpose of this project is to provide a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work internally, without relying on external libraries such as scikit-learn.
